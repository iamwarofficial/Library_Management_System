# Library Management System
 
Library Management System is a software used to manages the catalog of a library. This helps to keep the records of whole transactions of the books available in the library. Library Management System (LMS) is my project for the Java Programming Module. The LMS can Login, Register Users, Add Books, Register New Students, Issue Book, Return Book, shows Statistics of Issued Book and Returned Book, shows list of Registered Students and All Books. It has great UI, such as navigation bar, application theme and many more. It follows every command of the user properly and runs the application as long as it takes.
